<p>I am currently working on a joint PhD in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/">Linguistics</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/phl/">Philosophy</a> at the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>. I received my MA in General Linguistics from the University of Rochester in 2020 and my BA from <a href="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</a> in English Literature, with a minor in French, in 2018.</p>

<p>I'm interested in what things mean and how they can mean them. My research focuses on lexical semantics, metaphysics, mereology, philosophy of language, and the syntax-semantics interface. I am particularily interested in the semantics of count and mass nouns. My other side research interests include philosophy of music, literacy, the history of writing systems, and internet language and humor.</p>

<p>When I'm not in class or doing research, you can find me making cocktails, baking cakes, playing board games, brewing big pots of tea, and curating my meme collection. I served as the Graduate Student Assocation president for Arts, Sciences, and Engineering at the University of Rochester from 2020-2022 and I also volunteer with the <a href="https://rocmutualaid.com/">Rochester Mutual Aid Network</a>.</p>
