<p>I am currently working on a joint PhD in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/">Linguistics</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/phl/">Philosophy</a> at the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>. I received my MA in General Linguistics from the University of Rochester and my BA from <a href="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</a> in English Literature, with a minor in French.</p>

<p>I'm interested in what things mean and how they can mean them. My research focuses on lexical semantics, metaphysics, philosophy of language, computational models of semantic theory, and the syntax-semantics interface. I am particularily interested in abstract nouns, including their syntactic distributuion and how they interact with countability and quantification. My other side research interests include literacy, the history of writing systems, dictionaries, internet language and humor, Marxist theory, and writing center theory.</p>

<p>When I'm not in class or doing research, you can find me playing board games, messing around in the kitchen, writing poetry, brewing big pots of tea, curating my meme collection, thrift shopping, and baking banana bread on a semi-weekly basis. I also volunteer with the <a href="https://rocmutualaid.com/">Rochester Mutual Aid Network</a>.</p>
